 The goal of this project is to familiarize myself with web scraping using the ``BeautifulSoup`` python library and bonus point if I can get myself some movie plans for the weekends :).

I decided to scrap the IMDb website which is the reference site when it comes to movies and series in order to find the best 5 movies/series sorted by language or by genre.
